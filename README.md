# Naive-Bayes-TAN
## The algorithm to carry out the Naive Bayes & TAN
1. The "credit_train.arff" and the "credit_test.arff" are the train data and the test data for the model
2. The "bayes.py" is the code for the model (python3) it contains two model
3. For the output, you will get your model and the predict results and the accuracy for your test data
